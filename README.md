# Campus-Job-Notifier
Have you ever been disappointed to know that you got rejected a job or didn't know when the job posted because you applied too late?
How many times have you missed a job opportunity because you didn’t know your department was hiring for that position?
Most people don’t know when the new jobs will post in our student employment website. So people, who are looking for jobs on the campus they need to check the website regularly
